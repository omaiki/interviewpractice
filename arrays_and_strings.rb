# Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string
# without using any additional bu#er. NOTE: One or two additional variables are !ne.
# An extra copy of the array is not.
# FOLLOW UP
# Write the test cases for this method.



# -------------------------------------------------------

# Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not




# -------------------------------------------------------

# Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’

# Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
# bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?




# -------------------------------------------------------

# Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
# column is set to 0.




# -------------------------------------------------------

# Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of
# another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using
# only one call to isSubstring (i.e., “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”).
