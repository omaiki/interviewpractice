# String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
# of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
# "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
# the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

# def string_compression(string)
#   container = [ [] ]
#   string_array = string.split('')
#   string_array.each do |char|
#     counter = 0
#     if container[0] = []
#       container[0] << char
#     elsif container[]



#   end

# end

string_compression("aabcccccaaa")
